Some toy CFD simulations written in various languages

Since this repository has received some attention it bears mentioning that the physics of the vortex dynamics simulation has an error; that is, the strengths of the vortex rings grow with their size rather than remain constant. 

Any serious use of this or the potential flow code really needs to involve some validation, if that was not obvious.
